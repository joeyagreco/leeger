    Used to calculate all SSL stats.

    SSL stands for "Score Success Luck", which are 3 stats calculated here that go hand in hand.

    Team Score = How good a team is
    Team Success = How successful a team is
    Team Luck = How lucky a team is

    So Team Luck = Team Success - Team Score

    NOTE:
    These formulas uses several "magic" numbers as multipliers, which typically should be avoided.
    However, these numbers can be tweaked and the Team SSL relative to the test_league will remain roughly the same.
    This stat is more accurate with larger sample sizes (the more games played, the better).

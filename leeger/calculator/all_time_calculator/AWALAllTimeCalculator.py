        AWAL stands for Adjusted Wins Against the League.
        It is exactly that, an adjustment added to the Wins Against the League (or WAL) of a team.
        In simple terms, this stat more accurately represents how many WAL any given team should have.
        i.e. A team with 6.3 AWAL "deserves" 6.3 WAL.

        AWAL = W * (1/L) + T * (0.5/L)
        Where:
        W = Teams outscored in a week
        T = Teams tied in a week
        L = Opponents in a week (usually test_league size - 1)

        Returns the number of Adjusted Wins Against the League for each Owner in the given League.
        Returns None for an Owner if they have no games played in the range.

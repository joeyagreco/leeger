## Overview

![](https://github.com/joeyagreco/leeger/blob/main/img/leeger-overview-transparent.png)
This library allows you to take data from an existing fantasy football league and get instant stats from that league
into either a Python script or an Excel spreadsheet.\
\
This library supports multiple fantasy sites AND manual league data input.\
\
Python stats will be stored in these objects:

- [AllTimeStatSheet](https://github.com/joeyagreco/leeger/blob/main/leeger/model/stat/AllTimeStatSheet.py)
- [YearStatSheet](https://github.com/joeyagreco/leeger/blob/main/leeger/model/stat/YearStatSheet.py)

Excel sheets will include:

- A tab for each year with team stats
- A tab for each year with matchup info
- A tab for all-time with team stats
- A tab for all-time with matchup info
- A tab for all-time with owner stats

\
The main idea behind this library is:

1. Load stats into a League object
2. Pass this League object into various library methods to extract stats

\
For guides on how to use this library, see the information
under [Supported League Loaders](https://github.com/joeyagreco/leeger#supported-league-loaders) and
in the [`example`](https://github.com/joeyagreco/leeger/tree/main/example) folder.

## Quickstart Guide

#### 1. Download Python

- Download the latest _supported_ version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3109/).
- Currently, Python version 3.10+ is supported

#### 2. Create a basic Python file to use this library

- Create a file that ends in the extension ".py"
  - Example: _my_script.py_

#### 3. Download this library

- Navigate in your terminal to the directory where you created your Python script in Step 2
- Run the command `pip install leeger`
  - If you do not have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) installed, you will need to install it

#### 4. Download your league data using a league loader

- Find the site/s you use for fantasy football [here](https://github.com/joeyagreco/leeger#supported-league-loaders)
- Follow the **Setup Documentation**
- Once you have everything you need for your selected site/s, use the code examples
  found [here](https://github.com/joeyagreco/leeger/tree/main/example/league_loader) for your specific site/s to
  download your league data
  - You can put the code inside the Python script you created in Step 2
- If you have leagues that are continued in multiple sites, you can pull from multiple sites and add the League objects
  together to combine the different sites
  - An example of this can be
    found [here](https://github.com/joeyagreco/leeger/blob/main/example/league/combiningLeagues.py)

#### 5. Run your script

- Navigate in your terminal to the directory where you created your Python script in Step 2
- Run the command `py my_script.py`
  - Replace _my_script.py_ with whatever you named your script in Step 2

#### 6. Load your league stats into Excel

- Slightly alter your script from Step 2 to include a function call to load your league stats into Excel
- Follow [this example](https://github.com/joeyagreco/leeger/blob/main/example/stat/statsToExcelExample.py)
- Make sure that you are passing the League object that you pulled from the league loader/s into the function call to
  put your stats into Excel

## FAQ

**Question:**
I'm getting this error when I run my script:

<!---
// @formatter:off
-->

```python3
TypeError: dataclass() got an unexpected keyword argument 'kw_only'
```

<!---
// @formatter:on
-->

**Answer:**
This error occurs when the Python version you are using is not 3.10 or greater.\
Make sure you are using Python version 3.10 or a newer version.

---

**Q:**
How do I use this library to pull stats from my online fantasy league?

**A:**

1. Find your fantasy site [here](https://github.com/joeyagreco/leeger#supported-league-loaders) and ensure you have
   everything you need for the site you are using
2. Follow the [example code snippets](https://github.com/joeyagreco/leeger/tree/main/example/league_loader) for your
   fantasy site to load the League object

---

**Q:**
How can I get stats into Excel once I have my League object?

**A:**
Follow [this example code](https://github.com/joeyagreco/leeger/blob/main/example/stat/statsToExcelExample.py).

---

**Q:**
Can I combine years from different fantasy sites that are loaded as separate League objects into a single League object?

**A:**
Yes, the League object supports addition (+) to combine multiple league objects.\
An example of this can be
found [here](https://github.com/joeyagreco/leeger/blob/main/example/league/combiningLeagues.py).

---

**Q:**
Can I disable validation on my League object?

**A:**
Yes. While it is not recommended that you disable this, as validation ensures the stats are calculated properly,
disabling validation can be done by passing `validate=False` into any method that takes a League object OR any `loadLeague()` method from a League Loader.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install.

```bash
pip install leeger
```
